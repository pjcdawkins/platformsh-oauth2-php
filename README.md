# platformsh/oauth2

This is a PHP OAuth2 client library for Platform.sh, which provides a
middleware for Guzzle (version 6) that authenticates requests.

This library should probably not be used directly. Use the [platformsh/client](https://packagist.org/packages/platformsh/client) library instead.
